#21 is a card game that have a simple objective and a simple set of rules.
#The objective of the game is to get the highest total without exceeding 21.
#Each player has an independent game against the dealer and the objective is to beat the dealer.
#If the player's cards total is higher then 21, it is called a "bust" and the dealer wins, Even if the dealer have a bust as well.
#If the player and the dealer have the same point value it counts as a draw and called a "push".
#A 21 hand value is calculated as follows:
#Cards of 2 - 10 are worth their face value.
#Jack, Queen and King are also worth 10 each.
#The Ace card is worth 11, unless it causes the player to bust his hand and in this case the Ace card can be counted as 1. 
#A 2 cards hand with ace and a 10 value card is called a "blackjack" and it is a winning hand unless the dealer have an ace and a 10 value 2 cards hand is well, in this case it is a drew ("push").
#The game course:
#After all players have placed their bets, the dealer deals each player with 2 cards including himself, the dealers first card will be face up and the other is face down.
#21 player play options:
#In 21, the player have 5 options for playing his hand:
#1. Hit - Get another card.
#2. Stand - Stay with the current hand.
#3. Surrender - Forfeit the hand and get back just half of the wager.
#4. Double down - Double the bet amount and take just exactly 1 more card.
#5. Split - possible only when both cards are of the same value, means to double the wager and have each card be the first card of a new hand.
